SKYBOX IMPLEMENTATION DOCUMENTATION
====================================

OVERVIEW:
We implemented a skybox system to create a starfield background that fills the entire 3D space void, appearing everywhere except where scene meshes block it.

WHAT WE CHANGED:
1. Removed CSS-based background approach (didn't work for 3D game context)
2. Removed flat plane background approach (only covered limited area)
3. Implemented proper skybox using a large sphere surrounding the scene

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Created a 1000-unit diameter sphere mesh named "skybox" (changed from cube to sphere)
- Applied starfield texture using proper UV mapping via diffuseTexture (not reflection)
- Set backFaceCulling = false to render inside faces of the sphere
- Set infiniteDistance = true to always render behind other objects
- Parented skybox to camera so it moves with camera rotation but ignores translation
- Added slow rotation animation (0.0001 radians/frame) for moving stars effect
- Fixed texture stretching using CLAMP_ADDRESSMODE and proper UV coordinates

KEY PROPERTIES:
- backFaceCulling: false (renders inside of sphere)
- infiniteDistance: true (always renders at maximum depth)
- diffuseTexture: starfield.png with CLAMP_ADDRESSMODE (proper UV mapping)
- emissiveTexture: same as diffuse (makes it glow)
- emissiveColor: (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) - white to preserve original colors
- specularColor: (0, 0, 0) - no specular lighting
- disableLighting: true - prevents scene lighting from affecting skybox
- rotation.y: animated at 0.0001 radians/frame for subtle movement

ADVANTAGES OF SKYBOX APPROACH:
1. Fills entire 3D space naturally
2. Automatically hidden behind scene meshes (depth testing)
3. Moves with camera properly 
4. No raytracing/raycasting needed - uses standard rasterization
5. Efficient - single draw call for entire background

POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Use cube mapping with 6 separate textures for better quality
2. ✅ Fixed texture coordinates for proper UV mapping without stretching
3. ✅ Updated to use sphere instead of cube for more natural sky
4. ✅ Added slow rotation animation to make stars move subtly
5. ✅ Fixed color preservation by using white emissive color
6. Implement multiple layers (near/far stars) for depth
7. Add nebula or gradient effects
8. Use HDR textures for better lighting contribution

FILES MODIFIED:
- main.ts: Added createSkybox() method in createBackgroundLayers() using sphere geometry
- index.html: Reverted to standard canvas styling (removed CSS background)

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Skybox implemented and functional
✅ Starfield texture applied with proper UV mapping
✅ Proper depth rendering configured
✅ Camera parenting set up
✅ Texture stretching issues resolved
✅ Original texture colors preserved

NEXT STEPS:
- Test with your game meshes to ensure proper occlusion
- Adjust skybox size if needed (currently 1000-unit diameter)
- Fine-tune emissive color and intensity
- Consider adding mesh name exclusion logic if needed
- Experiment with rotation speed for optimal visual effect
